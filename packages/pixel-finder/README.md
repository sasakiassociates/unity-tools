## Intro ðŸ‘‹

<br><br>

### Features ðŸ¤–

- The `PixelFinder` object that handles the communication between scene data to the GPU 
- The `PixelFinderLayout` base object that can setup finder objects in different formations (`PixelFinderCube`, `PixelFinderHorizontal`, `PixelFinderOrtho`)     
- The `PixelFinderSystem` object that manages groups of layouts and supports working through a list of points to analyze from.
- Pixel data processed with compute shaders and stored back in the CPU for future use.      
- HLSL code for visualizing data without creating additional CPU overhead
- Handy extension methods for capturing screen shots or normalizing values

### The Pixel Finder

The main purpose of this package was to create a system that could move through a series of points and calculate the amount of pixels that matched a givent set of colors and store those colors for some of our analysis tools. The `PixelFinder` object is the main component in this package as it brings all of the magic from the GPU to CPU. It Each time the GPU receieves a `RenderTexture` to read through it goes through a set of steps to find the specified colors. 


### Pixel Data ðŸ“·

When there is a pixel match there is reprojection step to set a value to the pixel in relationship to where it's positioned on the screen. Usually a pixel dead center of a texture would be of more value than one that is off to the side somewhere. ðŸŽ¯

During runtime the pixel data is stored as an `uint` value type. Once the analysis is complete, the values are casted to an `int` value type to meet CLS Complaint. âœ…       


### Layouts and Systems
How the system works and reports data.


Some info about how the layouts types work.

Layout types to go in detail about
- Cube
- Horizontal
- Noraml
- Ortho

## Installing

This package requires Unity 2021.x + 

This pacakge can be installed in couple of different ways. I recommend for most users going with OpenUPM to add the package to your unity project.


### OpenUPM

installed using [OpenUPM's CLI](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#openupm-cli)

```
$ openupm add com.sasaki.pixelfinder
```

### Git Package

how to link the file with git URL

### Git Fork

how to fork this repo and referencing to disk


## Examples

Here are some handy examples that show how to use the package in your own unity project

### Running with the editor
